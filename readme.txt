Lets you adjust the quality of image thumbnails WordPress generates

== Description ==

Sometimes you may want the images on your blog/site to be pixel perfect, while 
sometimes you may want them to be compressed to save space on the web server.

This plugin allows you to select the quality of the thumbnail images generated 
by WordPress, as easy as that. Just go to Media Settings page and modify the Image 
Quality setting.

Plugin only works for new uploads, but in case you want to modify the thumbnails
generated earlier, you can either use

[Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/)

or if you are familiar with WP-CLI, then you can use this command to regenerate

`wp media regenerate`

P.S. It does not change the quality of the original image that you upload, 
but only changes the quality of the thumbnails WordPress generates from that image.

== Installation ==
1. Add the plugin's folder in the WordPress' plugin directory.
1. Activate the plugin.
1. Go to `Settings` > `Media` and set the Image Quality as needed.
